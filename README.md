# Federated Learning Algorithms (FedAvg, FedBN) 
This repository provides Python implementations of Federated Learning algorithms, including Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Federated Batch Normalization (FedBN). Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning framework that trains models across multiple decentralized devices or servers, ensuring local data remains private and is not shared.
Datasets Used:
CIFAR-10: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes;
MNIST: A dataset of 42,000 handwritten digit images. In addition, I have developed an improved variant of the FedAvg algorithm, called FedAvg-imp, designed to preserve accuracy in the presence of potential label flipping attacks.
